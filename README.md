## What is this?

Imagine you're at a concert, camping trip, or during a power outage - **no WiFi, no cell service**. How do you text your friends?

**This library lets phones talk to each other using Bluetooth!** Messages hop from phone to phone until they reach your friend - even if they're far away.

```
     You                    Friend's                  Your
    Phone  ----Bluetooth---> Friend's  ----Bluetooth---> Friend
                             Phone                      (300m away!)
```

**Think of it like a game of telephone, but for text messages!**

---

## See It In Action

```javascript
import { MeshNetwork } from 'react-native-ble-mesh';

// 1. Create your mesh network
const mesh = new MeshNetwork({ nickname: 'Alex' });

// 2. Start it up!
await mesh.start();

// 3. Send a message to everyone nearby
await mesh.broadcast('Hello everyone! 👋');

// 4. Listen for messages
mesh.on('messageReceived', (msg) => {
  console.log(`${msg.from} says: ${msg.text}`);
});
```

**That's it! Four lines of code and you're chatting without internet!**

---

## Why Use This?

| Problem | Our Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| No WiFi or cell service | Works with just Bluetooth! |
| Friend is too far away | Messages hop through other phones |
| Worried about privacy? | All messages are encrypted |
| Phone battery dying? | Smart power saving built-in |
| Need to delete everything fast? | One-tap emergency wipe |

---

## Cool Features

### 📡 Messages That Hop
Your message can jump through **up to 7 phones** to reach someone far away. If Alice can't reach Dave directly, the message goes: Alice → Bob → Carol → Dave!

### 🔒 Secret Messages
Private messages are scrambled (encrypted) so only your friend can read them. Even if someone else's phone passes along the message, they can't peek!

### 📬 Offline Delivery
Friend's phone turned off? No problem! Your message waits and delivers when they come back online.

### 🔋 Battery Friendly
Choose how much battery to use:
- **High Power** = Faster messages, more battery
- **Balanced** = Good speed, normal battery (default)
- **Low Power** = Slower messages, saves battery

### 🚨 Panic Button
Triple-tap to instantly delete all messages and data. Everything gone in less than 0.2 seconds!

### 💬 Group Channels
Create chat rooms like `#camping-trip` or `#concert-squad`. Only people who join can see the messages!

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the package

```bash
npm install react-native-ble-mesh react-native-ble-plx react-native-get-random-values
```

### Step 2: iOS Setup

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Add these lines to your `ios/YourApp/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Chat with nearby friends using Bluetooth</string>
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>Chat with nearby friends using Bluetooth</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
  <string>bluetooth-central</string>
  <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
</array>
```

### Step 3: Android Setup

Add these lines to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

### Step 4: Add this to the TOP of your app

```javascript
// This MUST be the very first line in index.js or App.js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';

// Now add your other imports
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
// ...
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Simple Chat

```javascript
import { MeshNetwork } from 'react-native-ble-mesh';

// Create and start
const mesh = new MeshNetwork({ nickname: 'YourName' });
await mesh.start();

// Send message to everyone
await mesh.broadcast('Hi everyone!');

// Send private message to one person
await mesh.sendDirect('friend-id-here', 'Hey, just for you!');

// Receive messages
mesh.on('messageReceived', ({ from, text }) => {
  console.log(`${from}: ${text}`);
});

// When done
await mesh.stop();
```

### Example 2: Group Channels

```javascript
// Join a channel (like a chat room)
await mesh.joinChannel('#road-trip');

// Send message to everyone in the channel
await mesh.sendToChannel('#road-trip', 'Are we there yet?');

// Leave when done
await mesh.leaveChannel('#road-trip');
```

### Example 3: Save Battery

```javascript
const mesh = new MeshNetwork({
  nickname: 'PowerSaver',
  batteryMode: 'low',  // Uses less battery
});

// Or let it decide automatically based on battery level
const mesh = new MeshNetwork({
  nickname: 'Smart',
  batteryMode: 'auto',  // Adjusts automatically!
});
```

### Example 4: Emergency Delete

```javascript
// Enable panic mode
mesh.enablePanicMode({
  trigger: 'triple_tap',  // Triple tap to wipe
});

// Or wipe everything immediately
await mesh.wipeAllData();
// All messages, keys, and data = GONE! 💨
```

### Example 5: Check Network Health

```javascript
const health = mesh.getNetworkHealth();

console.log(`Connected to ${health.activeNodes} people`);
console.log(`Network status: ${health.overallHealth}`); // 'good', 'fair', or 'poor'
```

## Using React Hooks

If you're using React, we have easy hooks!

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import { useMesh, useMessages, usePeers } from 'react-native-ble-mesh/hooks';
import { BLETransport } from 'react-native-ble-mesh';

function ChatScreen() {
  // Manage mesh lifecycle
  const { mesh, state, initialize, destroy } = useMesh({ displayName: 'Alex' });

  // Message handling (pass mesh instance)
  const { messages, sendBroadcast } = useMessages(mesh);

  // Peer tracking (pass mesh instance)
  const { peers, connectedCount } = usePeers(mesh);

  // Start mesh on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    const transport = new BLETransport();
    initialize(transport);
    return () => destroy();
  }, []);

  if (state !== 'active') return <Text>Starting mesh...</Text>;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Connected to {connectedCount} people</Text>

      {messages.map(msg => (
        <Text key={msg.id}>{msg.senderId}: {msg.content}</Text>
      ))}

      <Button title="Say Hi!" onPress={() => sendBroadcast('Hello!')} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** The hooks (`useMesh`, `useMessages`, `usePeers`) work with the lower-level `MeshService`. For simpler usage, use the `MeshNetwork` class directly as shown in the Quick Start examples above.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far can messages travel?
With one hop: about 30 meters (100 feet). With 7 hops through other phones: up to 300+ meters!

### Does it work if Bluetooth is off?
No, Bluetooth must be on. But you don't need WiFi or cell service!

### Can someone read my private messages?
No! Private messages are encrypted. Only you and your friend have the keys.

### How many people can be in the network?
The library supports 50+ connected peers at once.

### Does it drain my battery?
It uses some battery (Bluetooth is on), but you can use "low power" mode to minimize drain.

### Does it work in the background?
On iOS, it works with some limitations. On Android, it works fully in the background.
